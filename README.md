# Health Monitoring and Application Status Checker

This repository includes two scripts aimed at system and application monitoring:

1. System Health Monitoring Script(`Health_Monitoring.py`):  
   This script monitors various health metrics of a Linux system, including CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and running processes. Alerts are generated in the console or a log file when any metric exceeds predefined thresholds (e.g., CPU usage > 80%).

2. Application Health Checker (`Health_Checker.py`):  
   This script checks the uptime of an application by verifying HTTP status codes. It can determine if the application is 'up' (functioning correctly)(Eg."https://linkedin.com") or 'down' (unavailable or not responding)(Eg."https://httpbin.org/status/404").

Refer to each file for setup instructions and usage examples.
